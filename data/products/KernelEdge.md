# Product Record

# KernelEdge

## Overview
KernelEdge brings AI to the edge with optimized on-device inference for manufacturing and field devices. It enables low-latency decisions, offline operation, and secure model updates, reducing reliance on centralized cloud processing for mission-critical environments.

## Core Features
- Edge AI inference with model optimization (quantization, pruning) for low-latency runtimes
- Local decision-making and autonomous control for factory devices and remote sensors
- Over-the-air (OTA) model updates, secure boot, and tamper-evident logging
- Edge security hardening and hardware-accelerated inference
- Seamless cloud-to-edge deployment with centralized model management

## Use Cases
- Predictive maintenance and anomaly detection on shop floors
- Real-time quality control and process optimization for manufacturing lines
- Remote monitoring in field services and energy installations

## Development Timeline
- v1.0 (Q3 2024): edge runtimes and OTA updates
- v1.5 (Q1 2025): expanded hardware support and security features
- v2.0 (Q3 2026): multi-edge orchestration and federated learning capabilities

## Performance or Success Metrics
- Latency for on-device inference under 50 ms
- 99.9% uptime for edge devices in remote environments
- Bandwidth efficiency improvements of 70% by processing locally

## Pricing and Availability
- Device-licensing and subscription-based model; enterprise deployments available
