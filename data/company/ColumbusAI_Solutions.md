Our mission is to empower enterprises to achieve autonomous operations and data-driven decisions through trustworthy AI. Our vision is to become a leading partner for organizations pursuing scalable, ethical, and responsible AI at every layer of the enterprise. Core focus: AI-driven automation, software and data deployment, predictive analytics, AI consulting and strategy, and custom model development. We develop and deploy AI-based products for automation, business intelligence, and enterprise digital transformation.

## History and Foundation
ColumbusAI Solutions was founded in 2016 by Dr. Elena Koslov, a former AI scientist with deep experience in enterprise-scale data platforms. The founding team launched the company in Chicago with the aim of bridging advanced research and practical adoption for mid-market and Fortune 500 customers. Early engagements focused on automation pilots for manufacturing and logistics. By 2018 the company expanded to a blended services-and-products model, and by 2020 it secured seed funding to accelerate product development. In 2021 a New York City headquarters was established and a dedicated global delivery network was formed. From a local AI startup, ColumbusAI Solutions grew into an international consulting and product company with regional hubs and a nearshoring capability across the Americas.
